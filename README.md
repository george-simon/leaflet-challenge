# Visualizing Data with Leaflet

### Background
In this challenge you will work with the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short! The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. As a *new hire*, you will be helping them out with an exciting new project!

### Project Scope
Help build a tool to visualize their data which will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet.
